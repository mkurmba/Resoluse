The purpose of this project is to develop an HR system that will simplify the process of tracking employee work hours and attendance. The system will have a centralized database that stores employee information and last clocked in datetimes, allowing employees to easily log their work hours, including clock-in times, from any device with an internet connection. The system will be secure and protect employee data from unauthorized access.


### **Scope of the project:**
The HR system will be web-based, making it accessible from all devices with an internet connection. The system will have a sizable architecture, which can account for any future growth in the company and any rise in the number of employees.
The user interface of the system will be intuitive and very user-friendly, making it clear how to log in, log out, and view the clock in hours. The system will have a mobile-responsive design to make sure that it can be accessed from different devices, including smartphones and tablets. Finally, the system will provide feedback to employees after they log their clock in time, such as a confirmation message from the last clock in time.
Overall, this project aims to streamline the process of tracking employee work hours and attendance, while also ensuring the security and privacy of employee data.
